## 不定式

```
形式: to do  [n. ; adj. ; adv. ]
```

### 不定式所做的成分

```yaml
1.主语: 
	To see is to believe.
	头重脚轻it作形式主语:
	To talk to an Auarius woman without making her angry is imposible.=>
	It is imposible to talk to an Auarius woman without making her angry

2.表语:	(不定式作表语 主语部分有实义动词do的任何形式 表语省"to")(除此之外，连词连接两不定式前面有do后面也省to)
	The only thing (that) I can do now is (to) wait. [主语表示很确定(do很确定) 而表语 to wait表示不确定]

3.定语: 笼统的名词（序数词，最高级），不定式可作定语来缩小其范围
	He is always the first one to come and the last one to leave
	不定式作定语且与其修饰的词之间是动宾关系时,当不定式中的动词为不及物动词时,要加介词保持完整 eg：I have no room to live in./I have no one to talk to.

4.同位语:  (完整/抽象/等同)
	I have a dream to be a director.
	
5.状语:  修饰动词
	1).目的:
		I got up at 4 am. to watch the football match
	2).结果:
		1.only to do:
			He harried to the station, only to find the strain had left.
		2.too...to/ enough to...:
			She is too young to work in a factory.
			He is old enough to work in a factory.
6.宾语:
	1).Vt + 不定式:

		动词后接to do名词的有: 
			agree,	（同意）
             aim, 		（打算）
             ask,		（要求）
             choose,	（选择，决定）

             promise,	（承诺）
             refuse,	（拒绝）
             wish... 	（希望）
		 
		2.I do not know waht to do: 由宾语从句变化而来 (形式为 引导词 + to do)
        							(why除外) (此句由what I should to变化而来).
		  This book shows you how to cook meals.	
		3.I felt to report it to the headmaster my duty.:
		
	2).介 + 不定式:		（介词后通常接doing，除了but和except这两个介词）
		1)[but,except] 除了.... 在这两个介词后可以使用不定式充当宾语,若有do则省略to:
		The only thing I can do is (to)wait
		I can do nothing but (to)wait
		He seldom calls me except to ask for money
		
		2)其他的介词可以后接宾语从句在从句中可以用不定式:
		I am thinking about how to save the world
		
7.作补语: (主要是作宾补,宾补在谓语变成被动时可以作主补)
	I want to buy a car.
	I want you to buy a car.     主补 You are wanted to buy a car。
	....sb. to do ....  通常sb. 作宾语，不定式作宾补翻译为  (例如 advise sb. to do 建议某人做某事)
	advise(建议), allow（允许）, ask（要求）, command（命令）, encourage（鼓励）, forbid（禁止）, force（强迫）, invite（邀请）, require（要求）, order（命令）, persuade（说服）, cause（导致）,  teach（教）, tell（告诉）
	
	 下列动词作谓语若主动则省去不定式的"to", 若被动则还原（不省略to）
	 一感: feel
	 二听: hear, listen to	
	 三让: have, let, make
	 四看: see, notice(注意), observe(观察), watch
	
	表补: He is easy to deal with
```

### 不定式的时态和语态

| 时态/语态  |        主动        |           被动           |
| :--------: | :----------------: | :----------------------: |

```

### 不定式的逻辑主语

```
每个动词都有一个动词都动作的发出者
谓语的发出者为		主语
非谓语的发出者则为 逻辑主语

I want to go home. 		to go home 的主语为 I
I want you to go home.	to go home 的逻辑主语为 you


(省)To see is to believe		
(省)To learn English well is important.  => It is important to learn English well (it 为形式主语)

To learn English well is important for you(逻辑主语). => it is important for you to learn English well.(it 为形式主语,you为 逻辑主语)


It's adj.(difficult, important, necessary, dangerous...) for sb. to do sth.		外在客观用for

It's adj.(brave, clever, cruel, foolish, honest, kind, polite, selfish, silly, stupid,wise) of sb. to do sth.		内在用of

```

### 不定式的否定

```
I told him to go home.	在to前加not
I told him not to go home.
```

### 不定式练习

1. What __D__ you to make such a decision?		
   A.made	 B.let	 C.had	 D.caused
   只有caused 才是 caused sb. to do形式，其他都不写to
   与其他选项而言 caused sb. to do是   导致某人做某事，所以对于要做的事是不确定的，而made，let，had就有确定的含义所以省to

2. Will you attend the meeting __C__ next month?
   A. to hold	 B. being held	 C. to be held	 D. will be held

   表不确定，且被动 to be held

   

3. The purpose of new technology is to make life easier,__C__ it more difficult.
   A. not making	 B. not make	 C. not to make		 D nor to make

   to make表目的和意图 非谓语的否定直接在to前加not

4. Helen had to shout ___D___above the sound of the music
   A. making herself hear	B. to make herself hear 	
   C. making herself heard 	D. to m ake herself heard
   to make 表意图 句中Helen的意图就是让他自己的声音能够在音乐的声音之上

   且被听到表被动用 to be done 形式

5. The news reporters hurried to the airport, only __B__ the film stars had left.

   A. to tell	  B. to be told	 C. telling	 D.told
   该句中不定式的逻辑主语为 The news reporters 报道是被报告 填 to be told

## 动名词

### 动名词做成分

```yaml
1.作主语/表语:	动名词作主语,谓语动词是单数
	主语后置 it做形式宾语:
        Ating Dangsheng and Huangqi herbs is also for this. => It is also for this ating Dangsheng and Huangqi herbs #变后非常奇怪
        Trying to persuade someone whom you do not know on the internet is no use(no point/a waste of time) 动名词作主语 通常这三种情况下 可以主语后置 it做形式宾语
	
2.作宾语:
	Vt + doing :
		常见的接动名词作宾语的及物动词： admit, allow, advise, appreciate, avoid, consider, deny, dislike, encourage, enjoy, escape, feel like, forbid, forgive, give up, can not help, imagine, involve, mind, miss, practice, put off, can not stand, suggest 
	介词 + doing:
	 	with/without, for, of, on, at/by, in, to
	 	(in) doing 中 in 经常被省略
	 	to doing 会经常与不定式混淆
	 	常见的搭配:   [搭配] + doing
	 		have difficulty/trouble/problems/a difficult time/ a hard time (in) doing sth.
	 		have fun/pleasure/a good time (in) doing sth.
	 		spend time/money (in) doing sth.	 花时间/钱做某事
	 		when it comes to doing	 当涉及到做某事
	 		Look forward to doing		期待做某事
	 		Be/get used to doing		 习惯于做某事
	 		Devote oneself to doing	 全身心投入做某事
	 		Stick to doing			坚持做
```

## 到底是to do还是 doing

```
主要是区别他们作名词（主/宾/表）

to do 不确定  将来|目的|一次性
doing 确定	过去|长期|一直

只接一种		确定[过去]doing		 不确定[将来|之后]to do	
agree				❌					✅
aim					❌					✅
admit				✅					❌
ask					❌					✅
appreciate			✅					❌
avoid				✅					✅
choose 				❌					✅
consider			✅					❌
cant't help			✅					❌

manage				❌					✅
offer				❌					✅

remember		记得做过某事				记得去做某事
forget			忘记做某事				忘记去做某事
try				尝试做某事				尽力去做某事

```

### 动名词的逻辑主语

```
通常 形容词性物主代词/名词所有格/宾格/普通格 可以做动名词的逻辑主语

形容词性物主代词/名词所有格
动名词作主： my smoking here  makes me upset
动名词作宾： Do you mind my/his smoking here?
动名词作表： what troubles me is his/my/tom's smoking here


your tell him what's what is no use. => it is no use your tell him what's what. 


宾格(作动名词宾语)
Do you mind me/he smoking here

普通格(也就是普通名词)
I don't like smoking
I don't like young people smoking
```

```
特殊情况
1.如果动名词的逻辑主语是无生命的东西，就只能用普通格
Is there any hope of Manchester United winning the game?
2.如果动名词的逻辑主语是一个较长的名词词组，那他只能用普通格
Hvae ever heard of a man with common sense refusing such an offer?
Do you remember Rick and morty disappearing in front of us last month?
3.当动名词的逻辑主语是其他代词时，常用普通格
I was astonished at some knocking at the front door this late.
There is no chance of that being settled.

```



### 动名词的时态和语态

| 时态   | 主动         | 被动             |

```





## 分词

### 现在分词作成分

```
作定语
	单个分词作前置定语: falling rain
	分词词组作后置定语: The boy sitting over there likes singing.

作状语
	省略： 1.重复  （去掉重复S） 2.不产生歧义（谓语=>非谓语）
		do/does/did => doing
		be + doing => doing
		be + done => done
		v + p => p
		情态动词 + do => to do	
	若主语一致，则壮从省去引导词和主语谓语动词按上面规则变非谓语动词
	若主语不一致，省去引导词谓语动词变非谓语动词
	
作补语(宾补，主补)
	分词作宾补：
		I found the tree lying on the street. 
	分词作主补： （讲主句变为被动，补语就修饰主语了）
		The tree was found lying on the street by me.
```

### 现在分词的时态和语态

```
doing		进行的(与谓语同步发生),主动
being done		进行时（与谓语同步发生）,被动
having done		发生在谓语之前,主动
having been done		发生在谓语之前，被动

Doing:
	Falling rain; the rain falling down.	定	
	Seeing those pictures, he couldn't help thinking of those memorable days in his hometown. 壮
	Being so poor in those days, they couldn't afford to send the children to school. 壮
	There is a bird singing in the tree.	壮
	They opend fire, killing one of our villagers.	壮
	I saw him walking into the building.		补

Being done:
	The house being built has been sold out.
	Being stuck by the heavy rain, I walked into the bookstore to have a rest.
	I found the food being bitten.
	
Having done: 不能作定语和补语   只能做状语
	The leaves having fallen were brown.❌
	Not having received an answer, she wrote another letter to her parents.
	Having experienced quite a few earthquakes, we didn't take much notice.
	I saw the leaves having fallen.❌

Having been done: 不能作定语和补语   只能做状语
	The house having been built was sold out.❌
	Having been well attended for a week, my dog could walk all by itself.
	I found my bike having been stolen.❌

```

### 过去分词的时态和语态

```
done (vi[完成]/vt[完成，被动])

```

### 过去分词作成分

```
1.作定语
	we built the house last year. （及物才能接宾语，有宾语才能被动）
	the house was built last year by us. （被动）
	Time flies. （不及物没有被动）
	
	前置定语 vi. ✅
		fallen leaves.
	前置定语 vt. ✅
		a respected teacher. 
	后置定语 vi. ❌
		The rain which has fallen makes the ground wet. => The rain having fallen makes the ground wet.  		having fallen不能作定语
	后置定语 vt. ✅
		The house built last year has been sold out.
    

2.作状语
	vt.:
	When it is seen from the hill, our town looks a beautiful garden. =>
	seen from the hill, our town looks a beautiful garden.
	
	As he was born in a poor family, he got only two years of school education.
	Born in a poor family, he got only two years of school education.
	
	vi: ❌
	只有及物动词才能作状语
	不及物动词只有变成现在分词才能作状语

3.作补语
	Vt.和Vi.作宾补
	I found her gone.	(vi. 只表完成)
	I found my bike stolen.	（vt. 即可表示完成也可表被动）
```



### 不能作定语和状语的分词结构

```

Leaves having fallen ❌= fallen leaves ✅	
having done 不能作定语 因为 vi. done比其更简洁
The house having been built last year❌ = the house built last year✅
having been built 不能做定语 因为vt. done 比其更简洁

having done 和 having been done 不能作定语和补语
Vi. done 不能作后置定语和状语
```

### 分数的逻辑主语（独立主格结构）

```

分词作状语时，自带逻辑主语	[与主句逻辑主语不同]
If weather permits, I will go hiking.=>weather permiting, I will go hiking.
此时permiting的逻辑主语为weather

独立主格太笼统
(people) Generally speaking, men are stronger than woman.
