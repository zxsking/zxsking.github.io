# 从句

## 定语从句

```
I have an apple. the apple is red.    -> 
I have an apple and it is red.		  ->
I have an apple(先行词) /that(从属连词/连接词/引导词/关系词) is red
```

### 关系词的作用

1. 引导从句
2. 在从句中做成分
3. `代替先行词`

先行词 在从句中做的成分所对应的引导词

主/物:that/which 	主/人:that/who

宾/物:that/which     宾/人:that/who/whom

表/物:that/which	表/人:that



### 如何判断填什么关系词

```
判断定语从句 => 划出先行词 => 将先行词带入从句,看他做什么成分 => 根据先行词在从句中所做成分，得出关系词

做主宾表(名词词性) => 关系代词[that,which,who,whom,as]
做状语(副词词性) => 关系副词[when,where,why, 介词+which]
作定语(形容词词性) => 关系形容词[whose = of whom/ of which]
```



### 关系代词三大技巧

做主宾表 => 关系代词[that,which,who,whom,as]

- 缺宾语
  1. Vt			 This is the place ___ we visited last time.	
  2. 介              I know the man ____ you just talked with. 
  3. Vt2 + IO    This is the reason ___ she told me.

- [被动即完整](./被动即完整.md)(间宾除外)

  ```
  This is the place [where] the party was held   //被动   不缺成分  the place充当地点状语 
  This is the reason [that/which] I was told	   //被动 间宾情况 缺少宾语 =>  He told me a reason 变为被动为 I was told the reason 所以 该句是缺乏宾语的
  ```
  
- 关系代词做宾语可`省略`



### 关系副词

####  where <= 介词 + which

介词+which 和  关系副词在从句中都是做状语成分  所以两者可以互相替代

```
This is the place _____ we met each other      地点状语填where
但是 要将the place 还原到句子中 因为句子成分完整 所以通过添加介词给从句添加一个地点状语
we met each other in the place             which 代替 the palce 
This is the place in which we met each other
```



### 关系形容词（Whose = of which/whom）

#### 指人

```
I like girls ____ [hair is black and long /eyes are big/voice is sweet]
```

hair 属于 girls 先行词带入从句做形容词 表示 女孩的头发 用 whose 或 of whom(因为这里是指人，若指物则为of which)

女孩的头发  

前置定语：the girls' hair 						这里 是 whose

后置定语：The hair of the girls 			  这里 是 of whom 



#### 指物

```
I like books ____ [covers are shing/price is reasonable]
```

书的封面

前置定语：the books' covers 					这里 是 whose

后置定语：The covers of the books  		这里 是 of which

#### 判断步骤（!!!!）

1. 看主句是否完整 且 从句是否修饰名词      来判断是否是定语从句

2. 从句若不完整则引导词要选关系代词，若完整 引导词则要选 关系副词/关系形容词

3. 从句中有名词属于先行词  则引导词要选择 关系形容词

4. 从句名词前有the(限定词)用of结构(后置定语)    没有the 则用whose(前置定语)

5. 从句名词为不定代词或数词  则用of结构   (同4一样  the xxx 可以看作名词短语 而不定代词和数词与其一样是一个笼统的概念 学生的百分之八十 不能说 the students' 80% 而可以说 80% of the student )



### 非限制性定语从句

本质：

限制性定语从句：将一个东西的范围变小

```yaml
引导词:
	关系代词: that,which,who,whom,as
	关系副词: when,where,why,介词+which
	关系形容词: whose = of which/of whom
```

非限制性定语从句：从句并没有把主句的先行词变小 , 这个东西已经是唯一的了，从句只是对这个东西进行补充    （表现：在主句与从句之间添加逗号）

```yaml
引导词:
	关系代词: which,who,whom,as				相比于限制性定于从句减少了 that
	关系副词: when,where,介词+which			相比于限制性定于从句减少了 why
	关系形容词: whose = of which/of whom
```

### 考点：非限制性定语从句的引导词代唯一名词 / 整个句子  整个句子是唯一的

当代整个句子时 只能用which 和 as

1.意思   which：这件事 		as：正如

2.位置	which：放主句后		as：任意位置 

3.时间(本质)	which：分先后 主句先发生，从句后评价		as：不分先后 ，不强调先后 ，把主句当事实来看待

```
____ we all know ,the earth is round.     As
They found the murder , _____ surprised me.		which
```

### 定语从句的主谓一致

要根据从句中引导词所替代的先行词的单复来判断从句中的单复

带the的为主句的核心



#### That vs Which vs As

```
只用that不用which
1.当先行词为不定代词 或 被不定代词修饰
如(all,little,something,everything,nothing,someone,anyone,anybody)

2.当先行词是序数词或最高级或被序数词或最高级修饰时

3.当先行词被the very,the only,the last等修饰时
4.当主句是以who或which开头的疑问句时
5.当先行词即有人也有物时
```

```
只用which不用that
1.非限制性定语从句
2.介词 + which
```

```
只用as不用that,which    从句修饰的和先行词是一个类别，而不是同一个
先行词含有so,such as,the same时
```


```
补充：
1.先行词为“the way”(方式)，“the reason”(原因)时，从句完整时，引导词通常只能用that 或 in which在从句中充当状语
2.先行词为those时，//todo
```



## 名词性从句

### 名词性从句引导词系统

名词性从句中引导词通常称为连接词

- 连接代词： what which who whom  whatever  whichever whoever whomever        (作主，宾，表)
- 连接副词：when where why how whenever wherever however             (作状语)
- 连接形容词：what which whose whatever whichever whosever           (作定语)
- 侠义连接词：that                                                                          (不作成分)

### 名词从句的注意事项

1. 判断从句类型看主句；选连接词看从句
2. 从句统一用陈述句语序
3. 宾从的第一个that可省略；if <= whether；介词后一般不用that
4. 同位语三要素：完整、抽象、同等；that > 90%
5. 省略（G51）
6. 一人得道，鸡犬升天
